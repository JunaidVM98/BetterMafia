# BetterMafia

This project is a WIP üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## How to Run Locally
Once cloned, open in VS Code and navigate to the project's root directory in the terminal.

### Initial setup: 

1) Run **python -m venv game_env** (this creates a virtual environment called **game_env**)

2) Load into this environment by running **game_env\Scripts\activate**

3) Install all the dependencies by running **pip install -r requirements.txt**

4) Run the application with **python app.py**

The appplication should now be available at http://localhost:5000/

Once setup, you will **only** need to do step (**2**) and step (**4**) to run your local copy (unless the requirements file is updated in which case you will need to do step (3) also!)
